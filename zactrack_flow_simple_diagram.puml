title ZacTrack Integration with Flow Visualization System

' Define main components with simpler names
package "Physical World" {
  [People/Objects\nBeing Tracked] as People
  [ZacTrack\nTracking System] as ZacTrack
}

package "Digital World" {
  [Flow Visualization\nApplication] as FlowApp
  [Live Visual\nDisplay] as Display
}

' Simple flow
People --> ZacTrack : "Physical Movement"
note right of ZacTrack
  **What it does:**
  • Tracks position of people/objects
  • Works like GPS but indoors
  • Very precise location data
end note

ZacTrack --> FlowApp : "Position Data\n(Wireless)"
note right of FlowApp
  **What it does:**
  • Receives tracking data
  • Creates flowing effects
  • Responds to movement
end note

FlowApp --> Display : "Interactive Visuals"
note right of Display
  **What you see:**
  • Flowing particles
  • Dynamic patterns
  • Real-time responses
end note

' Add interaction examples
note bottom
  **How it Works in Practice:**
  
  1. **Person enters space** → Particles appear and start flowing
  
  2. **Person moves around** → Flow patterns follow their movement
  
  3. **Multiple people** → Multiple flow streams interact
  
  4. **Person leaves** → Flow gradually fades away
  
  **Benefits:**
  • **Interactive Experience**: People directly influence the art
  • **Real-time Response**: Immediate visual feedback
  • **Scalable**: Works with 1-50 people simultaneously
  • **Customizable**: Different visual effects possible

  **Technical Summary (for reference):**
  • ZacTrack sends data via network (OSC protocol)
  • Application processes 50+ tracking points
  • Real-time flow field generation
  • Multiple visualization modes available
